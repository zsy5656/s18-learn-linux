--Using Gedit:
Gedit is a program built into Ubuntu allowing for editing of text. This program works very similarly to a document editor like Microsoft Word or Google Docs, in that it includes intuitive commands like ctrl-c and ctrl-v, and allows for full mouse control. Writing a program in Gedit, like most editors, requires just a simple command:
    gedit [filename]
This will make a new file or open an existing file in Gedit. Just remember to save your work before closing out, and use gedit [filename] & if you want to run commands while gedit is open.
